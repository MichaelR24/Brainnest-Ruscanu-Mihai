1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?
A: var,let, just by typing the name

2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
A: var because it is an old way to declare variables

3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?
A: variable names cannot start with a number, hyphens are not allowed

4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and
strings?
A: it adds numbers and concatenates strings

5. How does the % operator work?
A: It returns the remainder of the operation

6. Explain the difference between == and ===.
A: === verifies the type of the variables being compared (both to be the same type, boolean,number,string etc. in order to return true
)

7. When would you receive a NaN result?
A: when we have an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation

8. How do you increment and decrement a number?
A: i++,i--

9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement
operators.
A: 
a=0;
b=++a; // first the incrementation, then the assignment
-> a is 1, b is 1

a=0;
b=a++; //first the assignment, then the incrementation
->a is 1, b is 0

10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
A:  it shows the order in which operations are performed in an mathmematical expression.

11. How do you log information to the console?
A: console.log();

12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
A: it converts it into a number

13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?
A: string, number, boolean, NULL, undefined, BigInt, Symbol, Objects

14. Which data type is NOT primitive?
A: Object

15. What is the relationship between null and undefined?
A: 

Null is the intentional absence of the value. 
Undefined: The value does not exist in the compiler. 


16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
A: There is no difference between simple and double quotes.
Backticks allow for variable implementation.

17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
A: String interpolation

18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
A:Backticks

19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
A: Using ${â€¦}

20. How do you escape characters in a string?
A: Using the backslash(\)

21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?
A:
substring() - gets a part of the original string and returns it as a new string,based on a startindex and a finalindex
slice() - the same as substring() but with 2 differences:
-if startindex is a negative number, then the first character begins from the end of the string 
-if startindex > endIndex, it returns an empty string

substr() - expects the second parameter as a length instead of an finalindex

22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
A: && - AND 
|| - OR
! - NOT

23. What are the comparison operators?
A: <,>,=<,=>

24. What are truthy and falsy values?
A: Truthy values are values that evaluate to True . Falsy values are values that evaluate to False.

25. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
A: false, 0, -0, 0n, "", null, undefined, and NaN.

26. What are conditionals?
A: are a way to control wether a piece of code runs or not

27. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
A:
if(){
}else {}

28. What is the syntax for a switch statement?
A: 
switch(expression){
case value1: code; break;
case value2: code; break;
case valuen: code; break;
default: code; break;
}

29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
A: condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse

30. What is nesting?
A:When you write something inside something else. (a function in another function)

31. What are functions useful for?
A: reuse code, easy to correct mistakes in code

32. How do you invoke a function?
A: myfunction();

33. What are anonymous functions?
A:a function without a name, which executes immediately, only once

34. What is function scope?
A: The function scope contains variables that are declared inside a function are called local variables

35. What are return values?
A: The values a function returns after it is called
  
36. What are arrow functions?
A:A way to write shorter function syntax.
